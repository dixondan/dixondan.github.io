{: #about}
Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) with Yufang Jin in the [Remote Sensing and Ecosystem Change Lab](https://jin.ucdavis.edu/). I mainly use remote sensing from vairous platforms (e.g., satellites, airborne) to map and understand changes in the environment at local to broad spatial scales. 

Before joining UC Davis, I received my Ph.D. in [Geography](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/department-of-geography-and-planning) at the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au) and M.S. in [Earth System Science and Policy](https://aero.und.edu/essp/index.html) from the [University of North Dakota](https://www.und.edu/).

My research is primarily driven by quantitative and computational methods. My recent and current research projects are categorized into three primary areas:

- **Machine learning**: My research is often driven by cutting-edge computational tools
- **Forest characterization**: I investigate the
- **Fire effects**:
